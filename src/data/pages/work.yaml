  - title: Become an Associate Partner
    description: >-
      Associate partners work with us on specific projects, conducting workshops
      based on their expertise, when they have time. They regularly offer their
      time to our projects. We do take time to decide upon an associate partner
      and usually between 6-8 months of a regular association is necessary to
      become an associate.
  - title: Become a Volunteer
    description: >+
      If you are interested in the work we do, would like to work with us for a
      short period of time and offer your expertise, you could join us as a
      volunteer. A volunteer may offer a programme (such as a workshop) on
      his/her own.


  - title: Become an Intern
    description: >-
      If you are a student and would like to join us to explore the work we do
      and gain some experience at the same time, you could intern with us. All
      interns who wish to work on-site will have to pay for their own stay and
      food. All interns will be given a certificate of internship upon
      completion of the internship.
