involvements:
  - title: Become a Full-time Volunteer
    description: >+
      A full-time volunteer is someone who is coming specifically to work with
      Srot and teach students here. They are involved with every aspect of life
      at the Centre and are prepared to take up any task or responsibility that
      might come their way. 


      Such volunteers typically stay at the centre with the rest of the team,
      where their stay and food is taken care of. 


      Contact us if you are interested in volunteering full-time. 

  - title: Become a Part-time Volunteer
    description: >-
      Volunteers who plans to spend only about 2-3 hours each day working with
      children at the Centre and typically are working a job or vacationing the
      rest of the time are part-time volunteers. 

      Part-time volunteers are expected to take care of their own stay and food.
      Assistance to find the right place to fit the volunteer's budget will be
      offered. 


      Contact us if you wish to be a part-time volunteer.
  - title: Volunteer from Remote Location
    description: >-
      At Srot we try to offer students the support they need. However, we have
      had a difficulty finding good teachers to work with students with PCM or
      PCB combinations in Class 11-12. 


      Thus we are often on the look out for teachers who may be able to take
      online sessions with students who need help in Physics, Chemistry or
      Biology at the class 12 level. 


      If you think you can offer such support to us and the children, do let us
      know. We would love to put you on our list and get in touch with you to
      figure out how you might be able to help the children here. 


      There are now quite a few students who have started thinking of
      engineering and medicine as possible career options. However, due to lack
      of proper academic support and guidance, they can seldom turn that into
      reality. 

      Your support can genuinely make a difference! 
  - title: Conduct Workshops
    description: >-
      At Srot, we have hosted individuals who conducted specific workshops.
      Workshop in Computers, Lateral thinking, Basic electronics, Basics of
      website development, Art and others have been organized in the past. 


      Contact us if you have an idea for a workshop and we feel, after talking
      to students, that it will be of interest to students and we will get in
      touch with you!
