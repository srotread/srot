In July 2020, a group of passionate individuals, including some members of the Himalayan volunteer tourism (HvT) Facebook page, came together to start helping students in Tirthan Valley, Himachal Pradesh by offering academic support. Soon, the work increased and the project born out of HvT became independent. By March 2022 in Tirthan, the Srot Foundation had:

1. Conducted several workshops in fields ranging from Arts, Dental hygiene, Mathematics, Puzzles to Robotics.
1. Provided art and craft materials to encourage children to let loose their creativity.
1. Counselled the older children about education and career pathways.
1. Set up small libraries in the homes of the children. After all, learning begins at home.
1. Provided academic support wherever needed.
1. More importantly, we were able to build joyful relationships with the children and their families.
