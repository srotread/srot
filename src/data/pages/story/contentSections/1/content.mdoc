Today, we have about 30 students who come regularly and another 12-15 who come from time to time, for the afterschool programme. We offer academic support to these students. We also help those in class 9 and upwards get more exposure through our volunteer programme as well as by interacting with others working in various fields by arranging meetings with them.

Apart from these there are 2 girls who live at the centre and are pursuing their NIOS class 12 certification. We offer them full academic support and take care of all their educational needs.

1 Student who wanted to resume her education after a gap of 3 years also has been receiving support from us.

Most of the students who we support in anyway belong to low income families. Hence, all the support we offer to the students is free of charge, supported entirely by donor contributions.
