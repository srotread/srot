While most children in Tirthan go to school and access to schooling is good, most of these children have not been able to cultivate the right approach to  learning. Everything they do is either for homework which they copy from guide books or for exams that they write by memorizing entire textbooks (Even the Maths textbook!).

The result is children often have no idea of the relevance in everyday life of the things they are expected to learn. They also do not know how to do it independently. The consequence is, they have marks but very little in terms of learning.

They also lack the exposure and the thought process to effectively consider and plan for a future.

We step in to fill the huge learning gaps and a mentorship vacuum in the lives of the students in Tirthan Valley.

Our approach is learning oriented rather than exam oriented and we try to help them learn how to learn.
