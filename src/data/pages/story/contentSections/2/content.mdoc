“What motivates these people?”, one might ask. The answer is simple and clear to us. No forest can be called healthy unless its diversity is truly appreciated and all its life gets what it needs. Nurture is important even to nature, and humans are a part of nature. Without the right kind of nurturing, we breed exclusion rather than inclusion, hatred rather than love, disdain rather than compassion, and a painful death rather than a peaceful end. There is no nurture without giving. We pray that we always have a positive effect on those around us and we do the little that we can.

All our work flows from these objectives. Everyone working on the projects has been and continues to work on a voluntary basis, without remuneration.

Over time, along with taking up new projects, Srot has opened up its doors for retreats. You may visit the Projects and Workshops pages to get a glimpse of our ongoing activities.
