“What motivates these people?”, one might ask.

The answer is simple and clear to us. No forest can be called healthy unless its diversity is truly appreciated and all its life gets what it needs. Nurture is important even to nature, and humans are a part of nature. Without the right kind of nurturing, we breed exclusion rather than inclusion, hatred rather than love, disdain rather than compassion, and a painful death rather than a peaceful end. There is no nurture without giving. We pray that we always have a positive effect on those around us and we do what we can.

Thus, the fact that, whether academic support or mentorship, the work we do is essential work that can make a real difference in the lives of the students we work with is what keeps us going.
