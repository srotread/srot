  The Centres are affectionate and enriching spaces that are free of fear.
  Children come over each day to study and have fun doing so. Volunteers
  regularly join in the work as well, teaching students new things, conducting
  workshops and even taking sessions with our teachers to help them learn new
  techniques and explore new new ideas.
