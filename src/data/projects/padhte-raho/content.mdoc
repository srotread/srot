***Padhte Raho!*** is a programme that the Srot Foundation runs to help the following kinds of students:

**a.** Those students who desire to pursue their education independently through an Open board and require support to do so. Such students typically need support with application to the Open board, study materials, academic support, exposure and career planning and so on. Often parents also need to greater clarity to feel more confident of such a choice since it is uncommon in the society they live in.

**b.** Those students who had to discontinue their education due to personal circumstances but now wish to resume and continue on that journey. They need complete support to get back on track having lost time and practice. They often also lack confidence and need our support to believe in themselves.
