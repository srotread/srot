This is the youngest centre of the Srot Foundation. There has always been a demand for such a centre among students from this village. Earlier when the main centre was at Sairopa, some of them would come there. But once the centre shifted to Banjar it became difficult for them to commute to the Banjar centre everyday after school. Pushpa, who was then working at the Mungla centre decided to start a centre in Gaidhar, where she herself resides and offer those students a space to learn and grow. She is the only teacher there at the moment, working with about 9 students.

The centre operates out of her home for now. However, we are hopeful that we are able to find a dedicated space for the children there so that more can attend sessions in the evening.
