name: The Resource Centre, Champawat
description: >-
  Work has been going on in Champawat since 2021 when Madan, the project
  co-ordinator, decided to give up a promising career in Delhi and return to his
  native village to help the children there. This is when another member of our
  team came in touch with him and Madan became a part of the Srot family. He has
  been doing all this work from his own small home, such is the large-hearted
  Madan and we support his work.
